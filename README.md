# 64-bit RISC-V CPU

This project is a complete design of a 64-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor built from scratch in Verilog. It closely follows the RV64I instruction set architecture and was developed with modularity, clarity, and extensibility in mind. All components are meant to be designed, tested, and simulated individually before integration.

## What This Project Does

- **Simulates how a real CPU works at the hardware level**
- **Executes basic computer instructions**, like addition, subtraction, and branching (decision-making)
- Helps understand the internal workings of processors, such as how they fetch instructions, decode them, process data, and store results

## Why I Built This

I created this project as a way to deeply understand how real CPUs operate under the hood. Rather than just using processors, this project was about learning how to *build one*. From instruction decoding to memory operations, each module was written and tested by hand. This project pushes beyond class assignments into real digital logic engineering.

## How It Works (Conceptually)
Even if you’re not familiar with hardware design, the processor works like this:

- Fetch – It looks at the current memory address and grabs the instruction.

- Decode – It figures out what kind of instruction it is (e.g., add two numbers).

- Execute – It performs the operation (like addition, logic, shift).

- Memory – It may read or write to memory if needed.

- Writeback – It saves the result for future use.

- Repeat – It goes to the next instruction and does it again.

Each of these steps is represented by a custom Verilog module and connected through a datapath.

## How I Verified It
- I used ModelSim to simulate each module independently.

- Designed custom testbenches to check every CPU instruction, including edge cases.

- Debugged using waveform visualization and manual signal tracing.

- Step-by-step module integration to ensure the system scaled correctly.

## Tools Used
- Verilog: For hardware design

- ModelSim: For simulation and debugging

- Quartus Prime Lite: For eventual FPGA synthesis

- Git + GitHub: For version control and documentation

## What's Working Now
- Full support for R-Type instructions (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, etc.)

- Support for LW, SW, OP-IMM based I-Type instructions

- Functional ALU, Control Unit, Register File, and Program Counter

---

## What's Coming Next
- Add support for B-Type, J-Type, U-Type, and CSR/System Instructions

- Build a pipelined version of this CPU

- Build a multicore version of this CPU

- Port the project to an FPGA and run real test programs

- Basic operating system support
